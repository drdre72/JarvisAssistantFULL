Jarvis Project Overview
Mission Statement
Jarvis is an AI-powered personal assistant designed to help users interact with their devices and information as naturally as possible—primarily through voice, conversation, and smart automation. Inspired by Iron Man’s Jarvis, the goal is to create an assistant that is proactive, responsive, context-aware, and feels “alive.”

Core Functions
	1	Voice Interaction
	◦	Wake-word detection (“Jarvis”) and always-on listening.
	◦	Speech-to-text (STT) for understanding user commands.
	◦	Text-to-speech (TTS) for natural, personable responses.
	2	Conversational AI
	◦	Integrates local or cloud LLMs (e.g., Llama, GPT) to understand and respond to queries, commands, and ongoing conversations.
	◦	Maintains context within a session for follow-ups and clarifications.
	3	System Control & Automation
	◦	Execute system commands, open applications, manage files, and automate workflows based on user requests.
	◦	Optional: Control smart devices and other local network functions.
	4	UI/UX
	◦	Customizable and visually dynamic UI (including animated avatar/body, JARVIS-style visualizations, and real-time feedback).
	◦	User dashboard for history, settings, and interaction logs.
	5	Extensibility
	◦	Modular architecture to support plugins (e.g., new skills, external integrations, additional AI models).
	◦	Easy for developers to add features or integrate third-party APIs.

Goals & Aspirations
	•	Proactive Assistance: Anticipate user needs, provide reminders, suggestions, or information before being asked.
	•	“Alive” Presence: Feel like an interactive companion—engage users with animation, greeting, status updates, and personality.
	•	Seamless Local Operation: Bundle all core functions into a single, efficient desktop application (not browser-only) for privacy, speed, and reliability.
	•	AI-first, but User-Centric: Use LLMs and AI to understand nuanced commands, but always give user control and the ability to customize responses and behaviors.
	•	Scalable & Maintainable: Easy to update, improve, and extend as new AI tools and APIs become available.

Planned App “Make-Up”
	•	Written in Python (favoring frameworks like Flet, Reflex, or PyQt for the UI, with possible desktop packaging).
	•	Speech Recognition: Local models (Whisper, Vosk, etc.) or cloud STT.
	•	LLM: Runs locally (Ollama, llama.cpp) or supports cloud fallback.
	•	TTS: High-quality local or cloud voice.
	•	UI: Animated “core” or avatar, chat window, notification area, quick controls.
	•	Extensible Modules: Skills/plugins (web search, system automation, smart home, etc.).
	•	Cross-Platform: Focus on Mac and Windows desktop apps (standalone .exe/.app).

Summary Statement for GPT/Dev Context
Jarvis is a modular, voice-activated AI assistant inspired by Iron Man’s JARVIS, designed for desktop use with a dynamic animated UI. It leverages local and cloud AI models for speech and conversation, automates user workflows, and is architected for extensibility and proactive, lifelike interaction. The project’s goal is to create an “alive,” privacy-respecting, and truly helpful assistant that users can customize, control, and rely on daily.
